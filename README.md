# React + Vite

This is a WeatherApp that has been created using a Weather Api to get all weather from all the cities that u give in the input , it shows u the tempreture , the wind speed , the icon of the weather ( foggy , sunny , rainny , ... ) and also the humidity percentage , i have used vite engine to create and run the app so that it can be faster 
i hope it helps u in ur carrier
